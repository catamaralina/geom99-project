## Ideal 
Using a web-based solution, staff of UDOT should be able to access current room-level information and navigate between rooms and outdoor spaces around their building.

## Reality
Staff currently do not have access to one single digital platform that provides room-level information for their business readily available at their fingertips. Navigation between rooms and buildings is currently paper-based and outdated. 

## Consequences
Issues can arise during emergency situations such as accessing the total number of staff in each room, finding the closest emergency exit, or navigating safe meeting areas outside.

## Proposal
Create a dashboard application that allows internal staff to view room-level information and act as a navigational tool between rooms and/or buildings.

## Technology Used
ESRI (ArcGIS Online, Indoors, Dashboard/Experience Builder)
